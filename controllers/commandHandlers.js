  <b>Game Rules</b>\n
  In the Dragon Tiger game, two hands are dealt: one for the Dragon and another for the Tiger. The player bets which will win, or if they will tie.\n
  The winning hand is the hand with the highest ranking card.\n
  If the Dragon and Tiger hands have the same ranking, the round of play is a Tie.\n
  The round ends in a Suited Tie when the Dragon and the Tiger cards are equal in both rank and suit.\n\n
  <b>Card Values</b>\n
  The ranking of cards is, from lowest to highest: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, and K (where A is "1" and K is "13").\n\n
  <b>At the end of the game, winnings are paid as follows:</b>\n
  <b>1. Dragon wins: 1:1</b>\n
  <b>2. Tiger wins: 1:1</b>\n
  <b>3. Tie wins: 8:1</b>\n
  <b>4. Suited Tie wins: 11:1</b>\n\n
  <i>Note: Suited tie is only applicable when the user bets on a tie. If a tie wins without user bet , then half the amount will go to the dealer.</i>
